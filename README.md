# cqrs_saga

You will learn how to build business logic that spans several distributed Spring Boot Microservices. 

You will learn how to create your very first Spring Boot Microservice and how to handle HTTP requests. You will then learn how to run multiple instances of your Microservice behind an API Gateway and how to make them discoverable. This will help you scale up your microservice up and down as needed.

This video course will also cover transactions across multiple distributed Microservices and how to roll back changes if an error took place. Transactions is an advanced topic and to be able to build transactional microservices this video course will teach you a few more design patterns. Starting from the very beginning, you will learn how to develop event-based Microservices that are absolutely location transparent.

You will learn how to use a modern and very popular framework for building event-based Microservices called Axon. Axon Framework is based on design principles such as CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and DDD(Domain Driven Design). You will learn how to build event-based Microservices using Axon Framework and how to use CQRS and Event Sourcing in your Microservices.

Finally, you will learn about the Saga design pattern and how to group multiple operations into a single transaction. This will help you build business logic that spans multiple distributed Microservices and roll back changes if one operation fails.

All from the very beginning, to make these advanced topics easier.
